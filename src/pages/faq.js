    <h2>What is the first bill you would introduce when elected into the State Senate?</h2>
    <p>Expanding Medicaid. Without full Medicaid expansion, Georgians’ taxes are currently used to subsidize Medicaid programs in other states, and we should bring this money back into the state to benefit Georgians. We should replace Pathways to Coverage, which is spending our taxpayer money on expensive red tape that insures less Georgians, with full Medicaid expansion. Not expanding Medicaid has resulted in hospital closures across Georgia, undermined our healthcare system, and left over 400,000 Georgians uninsured. Medicaid expansion is a bipartisan and commonsense solution that both red and blue states have already enacted.
    </p>
    <h2>What areas of public policy are you passionate about?</h2>
    <p>Making Healthcare Affordable to All: I know we can lower costs and improve care for those who need it most by expanding Medicaid, lowering drug costs, expanding affordable childcare, and supporting people with disabilities. Protecting Reproductive Healthcare: In the Georgia Senate, I will fight to ensure every family has the freedom to make their reproductive healthcare decisions without government interference, from abortion care to IVF treatments.
    </p>
    <h2>What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</h2>
    <p>Building an Economy of the Future: I will work to make Georgia a sustainable tech hub that attracts the jobs of the future, while supporting small businesses and entrepreneurship. I know every student in Georgia deserves a world-class education. Protecting and Defending Democracy: In 2020, I worked day and night to protect our schools, hospitals, and elections as a nonpartisan civil servant at America’s cyber defense agency. I will protect your right to vote from election deniers and partisan extremists. Keeping our Communities Safe: I know how important it is to pass common-sense gun laws to protect our families and neighborhoods. I am committed to expanding resources to support mental health and combat the opioid epidemic.
</p>

    <h2>What are your views on financial transparency and government accountability?</h2>
    <p>We need campaign finance reform to get big money out of politics. I do not take corporate PAC money, and I will work to ensure that only individuals, not large corporate PACs, can directly contribute to campaigns in state politics.

I will work to create an independent redistricting commission for the state legislature so that incumbents cannot gerrymander their way into staying into office. We need to make it easier for the government to hire people who understand technology, so that government systems are easier to use by the public. Finally, I will advocate for increased ethics oversight for public officials.
    </p>
    <h2>What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</h2>
    <p>I grew up in the community I aim to represent. I’ve not only helped build startups and small businesses in technology, I was a federal employee under both the Trump and Biden administrations, where I worked with both blue and red states to fix election security problems from 2020 to 2023. I also have a legal background and worked as a fellow in the Georgia Attorney General’s Office. In fact, some of my policy research and advocacy led to Congress’s introduction of H.R.3286, the Securing Open Source Software Act. I’ve always worked in a bipartisan manner, and value the importance of listening to those whom I disagree with. I will bring this approach to elected office and public service.</p>
